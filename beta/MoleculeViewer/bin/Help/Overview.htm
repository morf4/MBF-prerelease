                    <span>Currently biomedical research leverages
                        a combination of disjointed technologies to record data produced by and associated
                        with that research.<span>&nbsp; </span>The result is that much of the data which
                        researchers share is stored in stand-alone or disconnected systems.<span>&nbsp; </span>
                        Over time the context used to discuss key concepts can be lost and in some cases
                        the thoughts of scientists are not captured and retrievable.<span>&nbsp; </span>
                        The Kuhn-Stevens laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) is looking
                        to create an integrated system which brings together many different types of data
                        and allows researchers to collaborate on this data in such a way that the researchers
                        have easy access to historical data while still allowing them to add new research,
                        external reference data and analysis to their project’s data store.</span></p>

                    <span>Several distinct challenge areas exist
                        whereby technology could enable a higher level of productivity and collaboration.<span>&nbsp;
                        </span>For example, the research and analysis that occurs over weeks, months, and
                        sometimes years gives birth to a detailed molecular model.<span>&nbsp; </span>To
                        the layman, the model looks like a blob of atoms.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, to
                        the researcher, the model might reveal the secrets to understanding protein-protein
                        interactions critical in such disease as many cancers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Spinning,
                        twisting, and turning the molecules in a virtual graphical environment reveals the
                        smallest of atomic details that spawn hundreds of discussions, dozens of research
                        papers, and further research.<span>&nbsp; </span>Groups across the world can view
                        the molecules and share complex thoughts and ideas.<span>&nbsp; </span>But without
                        the proper tools, collaboration can only occur in pockets, discussions are lost
                        in email threads, and ideas and experiments are re-hashed because they aren’t effectively
                        collected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Good collaborative tools tuned to the needs of scientists,
                        research technologists, and doctors simply do not exist.</span></p>

            With mountains of data created daily, The Scripps Research
            Institute, a world-renowned cancer and biomedical research facility, needed to help
            scientists and doctors from a variety of disciplines link their work on potential
            cancer treatments with the latest research. Scripps Research turned to <span>
                InterKnowlogy</span>, to design a custom solution. Using the Microsoft .NET
            Framework 3.0, Windows Vista™, and Microsoft Office SharePoint® Server 2007, we
            created an application that allows researchers to examine 3-D models of cancer cell
            proteins, annotate the models with relevant data, and then share notes with colleagues.
            Researchers now spend less time searching for data and more time developing potential
            treatment solutions.</p>
            <br />
                <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;font-family: Arial; font-size:10pt">
                The IK team came up with
                a solution for Dr. Kuhn’s lab called the Collaborative Molecular Environment (C-ME),
                which provides a tool that researchers can use for data capture, visualization,
                annotation, and archiving. &nbsp;The C-ME takes stored information about cell and
                protein molecules, builds 2-D and 3-D models of these molecules, and makes the models
                available to Scripps Research staff and their collaborators around the world on
                a dedicated server using Microsoft Office SharePoint® Server 2007.</p>

                <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;font-family: Arial; font-size:10pt">
                The MoleculeViewer application is a simplified version of C-ME that removes the
                SharePoint collaboration functionality but retains the WPF 3-D rendering and manipulation.
                    It is provided as a demonstration and reference for using WPF's 3D functionality.
                    Sample PDB files representing four different molecules are included with the application.<br />
